## LICENSE

Don't Blame Us License (DBUL)

This license governs your usage of the software (the "Software"). By using, downloading, glancing at, or even vaguely contemplating the existence of this Software, you agree to the following terms:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to anyone foolish enough to use this Software, to deal with it in any way they see fit, including but not limited to:

    Copying, modifying, renaming it to something cooler, and pretending you wrote it.
    Running it at 2 AM while muttering, “Why isn’t this working?”
    Using it as the backbone of a world-dominating AI—though, like, don’t.

CONDITIONS

    This Software may not be used to train sentient machines that develop existential crises. We’ve seen that movie.
    If this Software breaks, explodes, gains sentience, or just decides to ghost you for no apparent reason, that’s your problem now.
    Any complaints must be submitted via carrier pigeon, with proper postage. We respond within 666 business days, unless the pigeon union is on strike.

WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

The Software is provided "AS IS", "WHERE IS", and "HOWEVER IT FELT LIKE BEING THIS MORNING."
There is NO WARRANTY of:

    Functionality
    Compatibility
    General usefulness
    Emotional support

Using this Software is like petting a feral raccoon: exciting, unpredictable, and potentially life-altering (not in a good way).

LIABILITY

The authors accept no liability for any of the following:

    Data loss, hair loss, or loss of sanity.
    Spontaneous combustion of your computer, router, or kitchen appliances.
    Embarrassing typos in your codebase.
    Any unsolicited emails from Nigerian princes promising untold riches.

USE CASES WE STRONGLY DISCOURAGE:

    Controlling nuclear reactors, missile systems, or robotic vacuums with abandonment issues.
    Summoning entities from the void (use version 2.0 for that).
    Using this Software to flex your coding skills in front of your crush. Just don’t.

LEGAL STUFF

If a lawyer reads this license and laughs out loud, you owe the author a pizza. Pineapple topping optional but encouraged.

Use it, love it, swear at it, but don’t blame us.

Happy Coding. Or not. We’re not your boss.
