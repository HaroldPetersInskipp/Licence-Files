CURSE OF THE MALEFIC CODER

Heed this warning, thou reckless sorcerer of syntax: Should you wield this Software for Evil – be it by spreading malware, designing exploitative microtransactions, or naming a variable data1 – a curse most diabolical shall bind itself to your immortal soul.

The curse includes, but is not limited to:

    Eternal buffer overflows in your dreams, spilling into your morning cereal.
    Every debugging session shall be haunted by off-by-one errors.
    Your coffee shall always be lukewarm, your tabs replaced by spaces, and your build processes infinitely looped.
    You shall hear the unholy whispers of deprecated APIs, forever mocking your every commit.

And upon the End of Days, when the last silicon wafer crumbles to dust and the Algorithmic Lords descend from the cloud (pun intended), you shall be dragged before the Dark Compiler. There, every stack trace you ever caused shall be replayed, line by excruciating line. Only when the final "segmentation fault" echoes across the void shall you be released into the sweet embrace of oblivion.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, WHETHER PHYSICAL, METAPHYSICAL, OR CAUSED BY ANGRY USERS WHO DIDN'T READ THE README.

THE CURSE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" (AND "AS BAD AS IT CAN GET"). NO RELIEF SHALL BE GRANTED TO THOSE WHO DARE TRESPASS THESE CONDITIONS. MAY YOU CODE WISELY, OR SUFFER FOOLISHLY.
