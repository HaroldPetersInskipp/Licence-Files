By invoking the powers of this LICENSE (henceforth referred to as “The Sacred Text”), you, the Humble Mortal (or Devious Entity), are hereby granted the following Cosmic Rights:
Permission Granted

  You may use this Software for any purpose, provided it does not involve:
      Summoning elder gods.
      Training pigeons for cyber espionage.
      Turning the Software into sentient AI bent on world domination (seriously, we’ve seen enough movies).

  You may modify, share, copy, or even worship the Software, provided you acknowledge the creators as either:
      “The Magnificent Architects of Code” or
      “That Weird Team Who Put This in a LICENSE.”

  You may distribute the Software, but you must:
      Attach this LICENSE and any related arcane incantations.
      Include a note warning others of its occasional propensity for sarcastic error messages.

The Forbidden Deeds

By using this Software, you solemnly swear (on your favorite programming language) that you will NOT:

    Build any device capable of extracting caffeine from a developer’s bloodstream.
    Claim this Software as your own while performing villainous monologues.
    Use it to embed Rick Astley videos into firmware.
    Summon anything with more than 8 legs.
    Commit acts of Evil (as defined in Appendix A of your conscience).

Should you violate these terms, THE CURSE OF ETERNAL DEBUGGING™ shall befall you, manifesting as:

    Segfaults that only happen on Fridays.
    Stack traces written in Wingdings.
    Deployment pipelines haunted by untraceable bugs that only occur during demos.

DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY

This Software is provided "AS IS", without warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to:

    Fitness for your weirdly specific purpose.
    The ability to get you a raise or impress your crush.
    Protection against supernatural possession of your laptop.

The authors are NOT LIABLE for:

    Explosions caused by merging branches at midnight.
    Loss of sanity while deciphering this code.
    Any summoning of unspeakable horrors via uncommented for-loops.

TERMS OF ENLIGHTENMENT

If this Software works as intended, it’s entirely because of your brilliance. If it fails, that’s 100% on you (and possibly Mercury being retrograde).

Go forth, code responsibly, and may your bugs always be features in disguise!
