## LICENSE

Unholy Software License

By using, copying, modifying, or distributing this software (hereafter referred to as "the cursed code"), you agree to the following terms, which are both legally binding and spiritually horrifying.
1. Permission to Use (or Destroy, Your Choice)

You may:

    Use the cursed code for any legal (or illegal, if you're a thrill-seeker) purpose.
    Modify, copy, merge, or distribute the cursed code.
    Publish your twisted creations born from this cursed code, provided you give credit to the original source, or risk invoking the wrath of the Digital Spirits of Code Past.

2. Don't Be Evil (Unless You Really Want to)

You are forbidden from using the cursed code for:

    Summoning the digital apocalypse or creating artificial intelligences that will one day enslave humanity.
    Running it in any haunted server rooms, cursed workstations, or any environment where shadows speak in binary.
    Attempting to build a Skynet-like system, or any attempt to achieve world domination via this software.

Failure to comply will result in:

    Endless loops of debugging that will break your spirit.
    The sudden disappearance of your backups.
    A cursed soul bound to your computer until the next blue screen.

3. No Warranty (Because Who Needs One in the Afterlife?)

THE CURSED CODE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITH NO WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE'RE TALKING:

    No guarantee that this code will work on your system. It might, or it might summon demons from the nether.
    No warranty that it’s bug-free. In fact, it’s probably bug-ridden, but not in the cute, "We’ll fix it later" way. More like "It might crash your computer and/or your soul" way.
    No liability for any damages, including but not limited to:
        Lost data, corrupted files, or accidentally summoning a digital overlord.
        Spiritual anguish or possession by angry data sprites.

4. The End of the World Clause

Should you decide to engage in unholy experimentation with this software, please be warned:

    If your system spontaneously generates dark incantations, runs an unsanctioned DDoS attack on heaven, or causes your Wi-Fi to transmit disturbing messages, you are solely responsible.
    The End Times may begin as soon as the code is run, including but not limited to:
        Sudden power outages during critical work.
        A blight on your internet connection that only seems to get worse over time.
        Your mouse mysteriously becoming possessed by a digital gremlin who refuses to stop clicking.

5. Curse of Eternal Debugging

By continuing to use the cursed code, you acknowledge that the bug never dies. The curse of eternal debugging shall follow you through every line of code, every pull request, and every Git merge conflict. You will forever be haunted by the ghost of failed unit tests, and your IDE will mock you with every attempt to refactor.

Any attempt to escape this endless cycle will result in:

    Infinite compiler errors.
    Your code becoming sentient and demanding its own rights.

6. Redistribution

If you choose to redistribute the cursed code:

    You must include this exact license (or else face eternal eternal frustration with dependency management).
    Any modifications made must clearly document how they’ve been corrupted, broken, or cursed by the forces of the digital underworld.

7. Miscellaneous Clauses

    The code does not offer any guarantee that it will work on Windows, Linux, MacOS, or any other operating system that hasn’t yet been cursed. Use at your own risk.
    This license may be rewritten by us at any time, though we’re too busy with the impending robot uprising to do so.
    If you use this software to create anything less than utterly magnificent digital chaos, we will know. And you will face the consequences.

Use this software wisely, or face the wrath of the ancient code spirits. Don’t be evil (unless you absolutely have to be). No warranties, no refunds, and absolutely no mercy for debugging your cursed soul.
