Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sub-license, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil. Any attempt to weaponize this Software, summon digital demons, enslave humanity via algorithmic overlords, or exploit its capabilities for nefarious purposes will activate the Eternal Damnation Clauseâ„¢ of this license. This includes (but is not limited to) fiery torment, relentless CAPTCHA loops, and spontaneous blue screens of despair.

By agreeing to this LICENSE, you solemnly swear (or affirm) to avoid all malevolent shenanigans. Failure to comply will result in the following curses:

    Your hard drives will mysteriously format themselves at 3:33 AM every full moon.
    The specter of "Clippy" will haunt your spreadsheets and PowerPoints for all eternity, whispering "It looks like you're trying to repent. Need help with that?"
    Any attempts to debug the Software for Evil purposes will result in recursive errors so devious, even Stack Overflow will mock you.

Remember: The Curse of the Evil-Doer will cling to your soul, gnawing at your digital existence, forever suspended in a hellish limbo of unsaved progress and infinite loading screens. Your flesh shall become the fodder for silicon beasts, your cries drowned in the laughter of vengeful sysadmins.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

THE CURSE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WILL NOT BE LIFTED. Any attempts to bypass or nullify the Curse through holy water, exorcism, or midnight rituals will only strengthen its grip.

Don't be evil. Or else.
