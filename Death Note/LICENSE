##LICENSE

Death Note License

By accepting this LICENSE, you acknowledge that this software is cursed. The price of its power is steep, and its consequences... irreversible. Proceed with caution.
1. Grant of License

You are hereby granted the right to use, modify, copy, distribute, and even sub-license this software (the "Death Software"), but you must adhere to the following terms to avoid an untimely demise or worse — a life of eternal debugging.

You may do as you please with the Death Software for Good, but if you choose to use it for Evil, prepare to face the consequences as laid out by the Shinigami King, or more realistically, your least favorite error message.
2. Terms and Conditions of Use

    You shall not use this software to create world-ending AI, rewrite the laws of physics, or craft an alternate reality where L is forever defeated. If you do, be aware: a cursed chain of endless 403 errors will follow.
    You shall not attempt to use this software for personal gain through nefarious means, lest you awaken a Shinigami that will haunt your IDE with cryptic stack traces for the rest of time.
    Any act of maliciousness, from over-engineering to shoving stack overflows in people's faces, will cause the Death Note curse to activate: Your program may eventually devour itself in a mass of infinite recursion, with no way to stop it.

3. Power of the Death Software

While using this software, you may feel empowered, as though you could control the fate of the world. However, keep in mind that with great power comes great responsibility... and the potential for horrific consequences.

Should you misuse this software, the bugs will come for you. You will be forever trapped in the debugging hell, unable to escape until you find the one true fix — which is likely to be a simple typo in your if-statement. The software shall give no mercy.
4. Consequences of Misuse

    If you use this software to manipulate time and space or alter the fabric of reality, your runtime environment may collapse under the weight of your ambition. Infinite loops may drown you in an ocean of infinite console.logs.
    If you attempt to share this software for evil purposes, the Death Note may return to its Shinigami Keeper, and your device may suffer eternal hardware malfunctions. Every click will be accompanied by the ominous sound of distant ticking.
    The software is "AS IS". No warranties. No guarantees. And definitely no resurrection after failure. If your project dies, it dies. You shall join the ranks of developers who watched their dream projects crumble to dust in front of their eyes.

5. Warranty Disclaimer

THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS," WITHOUT ANY WARRANTIES OR GUARANTEES.
If you attempt to create a digital utopia with this software and fail, it is on your head. You were warned. May your debugging journey be swift, for the Shinigami grow impatient. You know who you are...

    In no event shall the authors or copyright holders be liable for any claims, damages, or consequences, especially those involving broken dreams, corrupted files, or a Shinigami laughing at your loss of control.
    The authors shall not be held accountable for any physical manifestations of your “elevated” state, nor for the demonic possession of your keyboard when your code compiles and your dreams collapse.

6. The Price of Power

With great power comes the inevitable price. You might be able to shape the world for a time, but sooner or later, the Death Software may demand its due:

    Your development environment will haunt you, with silent whispers from L’s notebook every time you think your code is finished.
    Each commit will haunt your soul as you face down the consequences of your decisions — you’ll have to learn that, sometimes, "there is no escape".

7. Endgame

By using this software, you accept that the power you hold will ultimately consume you. Only by fixing your mistakes can you avoid the infinite, eternal cycle of errors. But if you fail... know this: the Death Software is always watching. It knows your secrets. It knows your typos.

The only true way to escape is to unpublish your work, delete your repository, and walk away from it forever. If you don't, expect your Pull Requests to be eternally delayed, your server to crash without warning, and for your internet connection to always be just one byte away from working.
8. Final Warning

Use this software with caution. The Death Software is not a tool to be wielded lightly. If you must use it, be aware that your every line of code will echo in the afterlife. Once written, it cannot be undone.
TL;DR

This software is cursed. Use at your own risk. Create, but be prepared to face the consequences. It’s not just your code that’s at stake; it's your very soul.

And remember: there's always a death in the details.
